# Goal #1: Align two sequences.
# Goal #2: Use a space-saving alignment (Monday's Lecture).
# Goal #3: Use linear gap-penalty.  
# Goal #4: Implement a command line taking arguments match-score,
# 	    mismatch-score, gapopen, and gapextend. 



# Inputs

# DNA sequence file 2
# match
# mismatch
# gap-open
# gap-extend

Outputs
# score of best locAL alignment.
# length of the best locAL alignment.
# alignment itself.
